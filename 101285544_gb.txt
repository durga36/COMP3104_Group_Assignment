George Brown College has been accomodating for students attending the institution with regards to those who are hard of hearing, ESL, and the physically disabled. 
The college has been especially accomodating during the pandemic by providing the professor the option to record the lectures and labs so that students can revisit them.
Would like to have my last semester online instead of hybrid.
George Brown College provide courses that mirrors the competitive job market thus helping students better prepare for the 'real world'.
This institution provide ampel support with regards to succeeding in school, getting a job, mental health, and physical health. They help students with creating a unique resume and cover letter so that the student can stand out from every other applicant who is applying for that job.
