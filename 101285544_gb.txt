George Brown College has been accomodating for students attending the establishment with regards to those who are hard of hearing, ESL, and the physically disabled. 
The college has been especially accomodating during the pandemic by providing the professor the option to record the lectures and labs so that students can revisit them.
Would like to have my last semester online instead of hybrid.
George Brown College provide courses that mirrors the competitive job market thus helping students better prepared for the 'real world'.
