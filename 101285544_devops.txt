The DevOps course introduces students to GitHub and helps them get comfortable with git bash and other bash command line.
Students get exposed to github, travis-ci, docker, kubernetes, and sonarqube.
Looked at pipline in class.
The professor takes his time with explaining concepts and theory whilst answering students questions. He also gives us daily quizes and class exercises so that we have a better understanding and have a firm grip on the practical portion.
After the midterm, professor will explain why the cloud matters for DevOps and provide relevant up-to-date examples to help students better undertand.
Near the end of the semester we will be learning how to write vagrant, YAML, and Dockerfile scripts. This is something I am looking foreward to.
